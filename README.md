# Best practices for Discord bots
- A continuation of the original project [https://github.com/meew0/discord-bot-best-practices]
> *NB: These guidelines are intended for bots running on public servers. If your bot is restricted to private ones, this document likely doesn't apply to you.*
1. **Use Slash Commands**. All **verified** discord bots will lose access to message content, so it is important that they are equipped with the latest discord updates, you can see more about slashcommands in the discord documentation or in your lib documentation (if have one).
2. **Prefixes**. Respecting the practice above, if your bot has slash commands this does not apply to you, if your bot still responds to commands by message (which I do not recommend), always try to have a unique prefix, which differs from the others, let's assume that the your bot name is "Ridwyn", your bot prefix can be `wy!`, or `nw!`, the important thing is, avoid common prefixes, like `!`, `.`, `;`, ` ,`, another interesting thing is that the user can change this prefix, if there is a conflict with another bot within the server, for example: `nw!prefix set rid!`, the bot would respond to commands with `rid!`.
