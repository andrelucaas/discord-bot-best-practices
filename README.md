# Best practices for Discord bots
- A continuation of the original project [https://github.com/meew0/discord-bot-best-practices]
> *NB: These guidelines are intended for bots running on public servers. If your bot is restricted to private ones, this document likely doesn't apply to you.*
1. **Use SlashCommands**. All **verified** discord bots will lose access to message content, so it is important that they are equipped with the latest discord updates, you can see more about slashcommands in the discord documentation or in your lib documentation (if have one).
